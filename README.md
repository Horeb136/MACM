# MACM

## Introdcution

MACM is a system that utilizes multi agents to interact with each other in order to continuously explore potential conditions for solving complex mathematical problems.

MACM extracts conditions and the objective from each math problem, iteratively adds new insights to the known conditions, and repeats this until enough information is gathered to reach a solution.
